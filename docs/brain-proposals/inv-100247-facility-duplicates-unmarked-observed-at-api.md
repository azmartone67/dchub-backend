**SPEC-ONLY** — this PR changes no running code and is not a fix; it captures an approved recommendation as an implementable spec.

# Brain proposal — facility_duplicates_unmarked (observed at: /api/v1/admin/facility-dedup/analyze?country=NL). What is the root cause, and is there a single unambiguous find-and-replace fix in one file that resolves it?

IF AND ONLY IF a single mechanical fix exists, end your answer with a fenced block exactly like:
```remedy
{"file": "routes/example.py", "find": "<exact current text>", "replace": "<exact new text>"}
```
Rules for that block: `find` must be text that appears EXACTLY ONCE in that file, copied verbatim; never guess a path or a line number; never propose a change under .github/. If the fix is config, data, ops, or a judgement call — or you are not certain the find string is unique — OMIT the block entirely and say plainly why no mechanical fix applies. An omitted block is a correct and expected answer.

## The approved recommendation

Choose between (a) the tactical fix: run POST /api/v1/admin/facility-dedup/apply?country=NL&confirm=1 (and AU, per the live finding) after re-verifying via the analyze endpoint, or (b) the structural fix: authorize scheduling the dedup apply pass as an automatic post-ingestion job across all countries so this finding class stops refiring. No code change is proposed; no remedy block is emitted because the fix is operational, not mechanical.

## Human checklist

- [ ] Confirm this is still worth doing
- [ ] Scope it to a concrete change (file(s) + approach)
- [ ] Implement + verify
- [ ] Or discard this PR if superseded / not worth it
