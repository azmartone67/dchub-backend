## The approved recommendation

Three choices: (1) For site-baseline specifically — revive the schedule or retire it into _INTENTIONAL_STALE_CRONS? (2) Approve building the deploy-time cron registry validation (schedule-or-retire enforced in CI)? (3) Approve the finding-dedup change (one open finding per condition with last_seen), after confirming it isn't already covered by the 2026-07-17 finding_false_closed_refired fix?

## Triage — 2026-08-17 (class collapse) — CLOSED, class member

Same condition CLASS as `docs/brain-proposals/agenda-100131-reliability-brain-finding-cron-silently-dead.md`, which stays
OPEN as the single obligation for `cron_silently_dead`. This doc's target —
`/api/jobs/site-baseline` — is enumerated in that doc's rolled-up roster, so closing
this copy does not drop the target. Act on agenda-100131-reliability-brain-finding-cron-silently-dead.md.

## Human checklist

- [x] Confirm this is still worth doing — the CLASS is still worth doing — this per-target COPY is not; canonical is agenda-100131-reliability-brain-finding-cron-silently-dead.md
- [x] Scope it to a concrete change (file(s) + approach) — scope belongs to the class in agenda-100131-reliability-brain-finding-cron-silently-dead.md, which enumerates every affected target
- [x] Implement + verify — one fix serves the whole class — implement against agenda-100131-reliability-brain-finding-cron-silently-dead.md
- [x] Or discard this PR if superseded / not worth it — closed 2026-08-17 as a class member of agenda-100131-reliability-brain-finding-cron-silently-dead.md (class collapse)
