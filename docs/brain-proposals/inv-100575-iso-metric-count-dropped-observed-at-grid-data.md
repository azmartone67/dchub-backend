**SPEC-ONLY** — this PR changes no running code and is not a fix; it captures an approved recommendation as an implementable spec.

# Brain proposal — iso_metric_count_dropped (observed at: grid_data: iso=TIDC). What is the root cause, and is there a single unambiguous find-and-replace fix in one file that resolves it?

IF AND ONLY IF a single mechanical fix exists, end your answer with a fenced block exactly like:
```remedy
{"file": "routes/example.py", "find": "<exact current text>", "replace": "<exact new text>"}
```
Rules for that block: `find` must be text that appears EXACTLY ONCE in that file, copied verbatim; never guess a path or a line number; never propose a change under .github/. If the fix is config, data, ops, or a judgement call — or you are not certain the find string is unique — OMIT the block entirely and say plainly why no mechanical fix applies. An omitted block is a correct and expected answer.

## The approved recommendation

Open routes/iso_orchestrator.py, resolve the aggregate fan-out code that TIDC feeds register under, then pull the last-24h error trace for that ISO's ingestion API call to identify which metrics are erroring vs the 2 that succeed.

## Human checklist

- [ ] Confirm this is still worth doing
- [ ] Scope it to a concrete change (file(s) + approach)
- [ ] Implement + verify
- [ ] Or discard this PR if superseded / not worth it
