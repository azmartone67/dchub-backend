**SPEC-ONLY** — this PR changes no running code and is not a fix; it captures an approved recommendation as an implementable spec.

# Brain proposal — iso_metric_count_zero_24h (observed at: grid_data: iso=EU_RO). What is the root cause, and is there a single unambiguous find-and-replace fix in one file that resolves it?

IF AND ONLY IF a single mechanical fix exists, end your answer with a fenced block exactly like:
```remedy
{"file": "routes/example.py", "find": "<exact current text>", "replace": "<exact new text>"}
```
Rules for that block: `find` must be text that appears EXACTLY ONCE in that file, copied verbatim; never guess a path or a line number; never propose a change under .github/. If the fix is config, data, ops, or a judgement call — or you are not certain the find string is unique — OMIT the block entirely and say plainly why no mechanical fix applies. An omitted block is a correct and expected answer.

## The approved recommendation

Open the ENTSO-E ISO ingestion workflow (the scheduled job that writes grid_data for EU_* / ENTSOE) and inspect its last run status and logs to confirm the loop stalled — start from the workflow referenced in brain_findings/10074 for iso_metric_count_zero_24h, and check the cron entry '29 */2 * * *' flagged for collision as the likely scheduling cause before restarting it.

## Triage — 2026-09-26 (class collapse) — CLOSED, class member

Same condition CLASS as `docs/brain-proposals/inv-100138-iso-metric-count-zero-24h-observed-at-grid-dat.md`, which stays
OPEN as the single obligation for `iso_metric_count_zero_24h`. This doc's target —
`grid_data: iso=EU_RO` — is enumerated in that doc's rolled-up roster, so closing
this copy does not drop the target. Act on inv-100138-iso-metric-count-zero-24h-observed-at-grid-dat.md.

## Human checklist

- [x] Confirm this is still worth doing — the CLASS is still worth doing — this per-target COPY is not; canonical is inv-100138-iso-metric-count-zero-24h-observed-at-grid-dat.md
- [x] Scope it to a concrete change (file(s) + approach) — scope belongs to the class in inv-100138-iso-metric-count-zero-24h-observed-at-grid-dat.md, which enumerates every affected target
- [x] Implement + verify — one fix serves the whole class — implement against inv-100138-iso-metric-count-zero-24h-observed-at-grid-dat.md
- [x] Or discard this PR if superseded / not worth it — closed 2026-09-26 as a class member of inv-100138-iso-metric-count-zero-24h-observed-at-grid-dat.md (class collapse)
