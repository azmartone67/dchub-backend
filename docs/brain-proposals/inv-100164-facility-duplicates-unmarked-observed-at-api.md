**SPEC-ONLY** — this PR changes no running code and is not a fix; it captures an approved recommendation as an implementable spec.

# Brain proposal — facility_duplicates_unmarked (observed at: /api/v1/admin/facility-dedup/analyze?country=SG). What is the root cause, and is there a single unambiguous find-and-replace fix in one file that resolves it?

IF AND ONLY IF a single mechanical fix exists, end your answer with a fenced block exactly like:
```remedy
{"file": "routes/example.py", "find": "<exact current text>", "replace": "<exact new text>"}
```
Rules for that block: `find` must be text that appears EXACTLY ONCE in that file, copied verbatim; never guess a path or a line number; never propose a change under .github/. If the fix is config, data, ops, or a judgement call — or you are not certain the find string is unique — OMIT the block entirely and say plainly why no mechanical fix applies. An omitted block is a correct and expected answer.

## The approved recommendation

Decide whether to (1) run POST /api/v1/admin/facility-dedup/apply?confirm=1 for the currently-flagged countries (BR, GB, US, CA, FR) and re-verify SG via analyze, and (2) approve scheduling the dedup apply as a recurring automated job (with or without a dry-run gate) instead of continuing manual per-country runs. No code remedy block is proposed because no single unambiguous find-and-replace fix exists for this data/ops issue.

## Human checklist

- [ ] Confirm this is still worth doing
- [ ] Scope it to a concrete change (file(s) + approach)
- [ ] Implement + verify
- [ ] Or discard this PR if superseded / not worth it
